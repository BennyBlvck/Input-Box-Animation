# Input-Box-Animation
A reactive Input Box animation created with just CSS and HTML; from watching a youtube video and recreating it from memory.
The idea is to help me practice what I learn. 
So, every other day, I read some blogs or watch a video on people's codes and try to recreate them whilst applying what I have learnt from coding. 
These are to act as milestones on my journey to growth
